            Since graduating with a degree in Piano Performance and Composition
            in 2015, I've taught piano and scored music for commercials, short
            films, runway shows, and feature films. Check out some of my work
            here.

            Last year, I decided it was time for a change. I wanted to pursue a
            career that was challenging and allowed me to express my creativity.
            Fast forward 8 months and I've learned the fundamentals of full
            stack development. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and Express.js
            have been the focus of my studies. I feel confident that my skills
            will make me an asset as a fullstack or front-end developer.
